To reflect the raw Nmap output directly in your README, I'll update the response format for the `/nmap` and `/sqli` endpoints to indicate that the output is provided in the standard Nmap format. This is common when using the `exec` command, which captures and returns the command-line output without further parsing or formatting.

Here's an updated version of your `README.md`:

## Introduction

PentestAPI simplifies the use of penetration testing tools by offering them as easy-to-use APIs. Currently, the project includes APIs for Nmap and SQL Injection scanning, with more tools to be added in the future.

## Features

- **Nmap API:** Perform network scans using Nmap via a RESTful API.
- **SQL Injection Scanner API:** Detect SQL injection vulnerabilities on web applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.20.1 or higher)
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PentestAPI.git
   cd PentestAPI
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Ensure Nmap is installed and accessible from the command line:
   ```bash
   nmap --version
   ```

### Running the Server

Start the server with:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### Nmap API

The Nmap API allows you to perform network scans and retrieve the results in raw Nmap output format.

#### Endpoint

- **POST /nmap**

  Initiate a new Nmap scan.

  **Request Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "target": "127.0.0.1",
    "options": "-sV"
  }
  ```

  - `target`: The target hostname or IP address to scan.
  - `options`: (Optional) Nmap options to use for the scan. Defaults to `-sT`.

  **Response:**

  The response will be the raw Nmap output as a string.

  **Example Response:**

  ```
  Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-08-04 14:30
  Nmap scan report for 127.0.0.1
  Host is up (0.00012s latency).
  Not shown: 998 closed ports
  PORT    STATE SERVICE VERSION
  22/tcp  open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
  80/tcp  open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
  MAC Address: 00:0C:29:6B:8E:7E (VMware)
  ```

#### Example Request

To initiate a scan on `127.0.0.1` with the default options, you can use `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/nmap -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"target":"127.0.0.1"}'
```

### SQL Injection Scanner API

The SQL Injection Scanner API allows you to check for SQL injection vulnerabilities on a specified target using the `http-sql-injection` Nmap script.

#### Endpoint

- **POST /sqli**

  Scan a target for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

  **Request Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "target": "http://example.com"
  }
  ```

  - `target`: The target URL to scan for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

  **Response:**

  The response will be the raw Nmap output as a string.

  **Example Response:**

  ```
  Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-08-04 14:35
  Nmap scan report for example.com (93.184.216.34)
  Host is up (0.045s latency).
  rDNS record for 93.184.216.34: example.com

  PORT   STATE SERVICE
  80/tcp open  http
  |_http-sql-injection: [INFO] GET parameter 'id' is vulnerable.

  Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.12 seconds
  ```

#### Example Request

To scan `http://example.com` for SQL injection vulnerabilities, you can use `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/sqli -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"target":"http://example.com"}'
```

### Explanation of the Changes:

- **Nmap API and SQL Injection API**: Updated the description and example responses to reflect the raw Nmap output format.
- **Example Responses**: Added sample responses showing what the raw Nmap output might look like for both `/nmap` and `/sqli` endpoints.
- **Clear Instructions**: Detailed the expected request format and explained that the output is raw Nmap output.

This README should now provide a clear guide on how to use your API endpoints and what kind of responses to expect. Let me know if there are any other changes or enhancements you'd like!
