## Usage

### Nmap API

The Nmap API allows you to perform network scans and retrieve the results.

#### Endpoints

- **POST /scan**

  Initiate a new Nmap scan.

  **Request Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "target": "127.0.0.1",
    "options": "-sV"
  }
  ```

  - `target`: The target hostname or IP address to scan.
  - `options`: (Optional) Nmap options to use for the scan. Defaults to `-sV`.

  **Response:**

  ```json
  {
    "results": [
      {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": "22",
        "state": "open",
        "service": "ssh"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```

#### Example Request

To initiate a scan on `127.0.0.1` with the default options, you can use `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/scan -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"target":"127.0.0.1"}'
```
